# Tutor-App

Brief

MVP
Create a web app to connect mentees with volunteer mentors, with the aim to help refugees and those from minority ethnic communities with English language and life in the UK.  
A mentee and a mentor should have individual accounts with different functionality.
Each user should be able to sign up to become either a volunteer mentor / buddy or a mentee. 

A mentee should be able to:
- Fill in a questionnaire and take an optional English test, and info will be stored in a database.
- See all tutors and be able to filter through according to gender, age, interests.
- Message tutors, and receive an email alert. 
- Edit their user page, including adding an “About me” section, and choosing a default avatar. 
- View the notes that the mentor has added to their page after each session.

A mentor should be able to:
- Fill in a questionnaire / sign-up page.
- Receive messages from mentees - receive an email alert, and be able to send a response.
- Arrange an online video session.
- Add notes to a mentee’s page after each session, viewable by the mentee, and other mentors. 

Extensions:
- Users can upload their own photo for profile
- Availability calendar for mentors to say when they’re available, and for mentees to pick their time. 
- Web hosting.
- Option to change language of the webpage.
- Location-based → for in-person sessions, and to see your local network.
- Mobile web app version with media queries (MP ADDED Sat 16th OCT)

Other:
- Functionality for mentees to review their mentors.
- Chat room / social function.
