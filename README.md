## Brief

A web app to connect mentees with volunteer mentors, with the aim to help refugees and those from minority ethnic communities with English language and life in the UK. 

- A mentee and a mentor have individual accounts with different functionality.
- Each user is able to sign up to become either a volunteer mentor or a mentee, and an algorithm sorts the list of mentors based on the information provided by each user in the sign-up questionnaire. 
- A mentee can then pick which mentor they want to connect with. 
- Once a mentor and mentee are connected, a mentor can organise an online session with any of their mentees. 


## Extensions:
- Users can upload their own photo for profile
- Availability calendar for mentors to say when they’re available, and for mentees to pick their time. 
- Web hosting.
- Option to change language of the webpage.
- Location-based → for in-person sessions, and to see your local network.
- Mobile web app version with media queries (MP ADDED Sat 16th OCT)

## Other:
- Functionality for mentees to review their mentors.
- Chat room / social function.
